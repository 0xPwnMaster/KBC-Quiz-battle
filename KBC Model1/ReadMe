# 🧠 Python-Based KBC (Kaun Banega Crorepati) Game – Model 1

Welcome to **Model 1** of our Python-based **KBC-style quiz game**!  
This version offers a simple yet functional implementation where all questions and answers are hardcoded directly in the `main.py` file.

## 🎮 Game Overview

- The game presents a series of multiple-choice questions to the user.
- The player selects their answers interactively via the terminal.
- Each correct answer earns the player **virtual cookies** as a reward.
- At the end of the quiz, the total score and cookies earned are displayed.

## 🚀 Features

- 🔁 Question loop with real-time feedback
- ✅ Answer validation and scoring

## 🧾 How It Works

- Questions and answers are defined in the script (`main.py`).
- The program loops through each question, prompting the user for input.
- Answers are checked for correctness.
- Cookies are awarded for every correct answer.

## 🛠️ How to Run
